# Two-sample-Testing

This is a R-package for evaluating 4 test statistics, including Nearest Neighbor Test(NNT), Energy-based Test(EBT), Hotelling's T-squared Test(HTT), and Graph-based Test(GST).
More importantly, there are corresponding permutation functions in this package to test the significance levels of the resulting test statistics.
For real-world applications and further technical details, please refer to the "Two-sample Testing Report"
